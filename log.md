# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Improved app load time of electron app.

**Thoughts:** I developed this electron app during GSoC 2017. It's still in development. Started reading whole documentation of electron. I understand the electron framework much better now. Also read React documentation, articles for state management. Going next to improve state management in the app.
